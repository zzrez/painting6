            <h2>The collection</h2>
            <p>This was built up over travels in the 1990s around Latin America but particularly whilst living in Quito, Ecuador for a year. We were simply stunned by the range of beautiful works expressing the colours, traditions, dreams and myths of the people.</p>

            <h2>Oswaldo Guayasamín</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most famous Ecuadorian painter, Guayasamín was born in 1919 as the oldest of 10 children and took to art early in his life. According to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswaldo_Guayasam%C3%ADn" target="_blank">Wikipedia profile</a>, he was named the best South American painter in 1957, at the Fourth Biennial of São Paulo. Most of his art is concerned with oppression in the lower social classes. <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/oswaldo-guayasam%C3%ADn/" target="_blank">more details</a></p>

            <h2>Tigua</h2>
            <p>Tigua art has become famous over the years for its primitive art. Tigua is a small village community high in the Andes about 90kms from Quito in Ecuador, and not far from the shores of Lake Quilatoa. It had always been locally well-known for their hand-painted drumskins. In the 1970s Olga Fisch, a Hungarian Jew and Bauhaus artist who came to Ecuador in 1939, suggested that the community  apply the same approach to pictures that could be exhibited on a wall. So was born the tradition of rural scenes, traditions and myths painted typically on sheepskin stretched over a decorated wooden frame. </p>
            
            <p>There are now estimated to be over 300 painters in the community. Judging by Tigua works appearing in a Google search, commercial tourism has resulted in a significant increase of supply at the expense of quality. When we were buying, in 1989 and early 1990s, only a few galleries carried Tigua art, and quality was noticeably higher.</p>
